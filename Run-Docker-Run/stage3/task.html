<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Now that you have created a <code>Dockerfile</code> for your application, it&#39;s time to build a custom Docker image based on it. This will allow you to package your application into a portable container image that can be run anywhere.</p>

<p>In this stage, you will use Docker to build an image from your <code>Dockerfile</code>. The image should be tagged as <code>hyper-web-app:latest</code> so it can be easily identified and used in subsequent stages.</p>

<p>By completing this stage, you will gain hands-on experience in building Docker images and tagging them for use in containerized environments.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Here are the objectives for this stage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use the appropriate Docker command to build the image from your <code>Dockerfile</code>.</li>
  <li>Tag the image as <code>hyper-web-app:latest</code>.</li>
</ul>
